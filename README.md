# Linear_Regression_Model
Code to create a linear regression model using a dataset of cars and predict values along with applying some data science aspects
like Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), creating boxplots and heatmaps,  Data Cleaning with Outlier Analysis.

  Before getting started with the code, be sure that you have pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn installed on your PC.
  <br>
  To install the above packages, open cmd and type `pip install pandas`, `pip install numpy`, `pip install matplotlib` and 
  `pip install seaborn` to install all the required packages.
  <br>
  Feel free to use the dataset I used i.e. `cars.csv`.

#### The Python Notebook is well commented and has headings to make it more understandable. Take your time to browse through it.
